GDIM 31 Project Fall 2021

#
Play through three progressively challenging levels, each requiring you to collect a specific number of points displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Keep an eye on the timer—let it hit zero, and you’ll lose! Each level features power-ups that can either aid your progress or lead to setbacks, so choose wisely which ones to pick up!

## **Use powerups to your advantage!**
